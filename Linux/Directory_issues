### Getting the Directory Path of the Currently Executing Script

The command `$(dirname $(readlink -f $0))` is used to get the directory path of the currently executing script.

``` bash
$(dirname $(readlink -f $0))
```



Here's what each part of the command does:

- `readlink -f $0`: This command resolves the full path of the currently executing script.
- `dirname`: This command extracts the directory component of a pathname.

So, when you run `$(dirname $(readlink -f $0))`, it executes the `readlink -f $0` command to get the full path of the script, and then extracts the directory path using `dirname`. This is a common way to get the directory path of the script, which can be useful for accessing files relative to the script's location.
