# üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Troubleshooting Guide From My Professional Experiences üõ†Ô∏è

## Welcome

Embark on a journey through a curated compendium of troubleshooting wisdom, spanning the realms of Kubernetes, DevOps, Cloud computing, and macOS idiosyncrasies. This guide is forged from real-world challenges and solutions discovered along my professional path.

## Highlights

- **Centralized Containerization Configuration Management Using Helm Charts**: Drawing from firsthand experience, I introduce a structured approach to managing configurations across Kubernetes deployments with Helm. This section provides a comprehensive overview of using a global values file to maintain consistency, along with practical steps and best practices.

- **Leveraging LimitRange in Helm Charts for Kubernetes**: At work, I explored how to use `LimitRange` objects within Helm charts to efficiently manage resource allocations for Kubernetes pods. This deep dive breaks down the configuration and integration of `LimitRange` to ensure pods have the necessary resources without overcommitting, offering solutions for common issues encountered in the process.

- **Storing Secrets in Helm Charts Using SOPS**: Security is paramount in Kubernetes environments. This part of the guide details the secure management of secrets in Helm charts, leveraging Mozilla SOPS and the Helm Secrets plugin. The provided real-world advice is crucial for protecting sensitive data within your deployments.

- **Mastering Git for Efficient Version Control**: I've compiled a tutorial covering Git's fundamentals and intermediate topics. From setting up your local configuration and mastering branching to handling authentication errors and changing remote URLs, this guide equips you with the knowledge to manage your codebase and collaborate seamlessly.

- **Resolving Longhorn Namespace Stuck Terminating**: Sharing a personal misstep and its resolution, I delve into the problematic experience of attempting to delete Longhorn from a Kubernetes cluster incorrectly. By missing the essential step of deleting PVCs first, I faced a frustrating deadlock in resource finalizers. I detail the commands and steps taken to patch CRDs, remove finalizers, and ultimately recover from this deadlock, saving valuable time for others facing this predicament.

- **Kubernetes Longhorn Troubleshooting**: Dive deep into fixing Longhorn namespace issues stuck in terminating states.

- **macOS NVM Solutions**: Navigate through common NVM pitfalls on macOS with ease.

- **Helm Chart Global Variables**: Unlock the potential of global variables in Helm chart value files for Kubernetes efficiency.
